# LRU Implementation

This project demonstrates the Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement algorithm implemented in a chat list interface. The application uses HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript for the frontend and integrates the LRU algorithm using HashMap and Doubly Linked List.

## Features

- **Chat List Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for managing and displaying chat items.
- **LRU Algorithm**: Efficiently manages the cache by evicting the least recently used items when the cache limit is reached.
- **Interactive Elements**: Allows for dynamic updates and interactions with the chat list.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the chat list interface.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Implementation of the LRU algorithm and interactive features.
- **HashMap**: For fast access and management of cache entries.
- **Doubly Linked List**: For efficient insertion, deletion, and updating of cache items.
